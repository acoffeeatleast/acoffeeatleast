- 👋 Hi, I’m Björn!

- 👀 I’m interested in data viz, coding, (frontend) design, history and archaelogy since I'm also a trained archaeologist.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis, better data visualization, Python and R

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything interesting.

- 📫 Find me on Twitter @acoffeeatleast or maybe on LinkedIn.
